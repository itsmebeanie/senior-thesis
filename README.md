##### Faculty Advisor : Finn Brunton, Spring 2016


###### I. Abstract

The purpose of this paper is to illuminate the role of game sounds in user play. The current literature on video game effects emphasizes that video games play a significant role on our developmental process without being able to offer much as to why. Indeed, understanding video game effects as a whole would be an arduous task. There are multiple layers of video games that all interact with one another to draw players into a game. Moreover, the layers themselves are intricate. Take for instance character design: there are teams of hundreds of people that work on the design of one character and what that character signifies to the player. There can be extensive studies conducted on character design decisions such as female versus male character design. Therefore, for my paper I chose to focus in on video game sounds and their effects on users. In my paper, I define video games as an interactive experiences through hardware in which there is a clear or foreseeable objective (For instance, getting to the end of a maze or escaping a castle). Within those games, I define video game sounds as the gameâ€™s soundtrack in addition to the sounds that you hear within the video game (such as the sound of a jump or a treasure box opening). I examine how these sounds come together to create an immersive experience for the user. In particular, I will look at how sounds act as a guide for players.
